# Buy & Sell App - Lighthouse Labs Midterm Project

Kigogo is a buy-and-sell app built with Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL. The app features a featured items homepage, along with the ability to view items, message sellers, and post an ad. In addition to these core features, users can favourite items to come back to later and can use the search feature to find specific items and filter them by price.
Sellers have a converstations page where they can access their messages with buyers, and can mark items as sold, which will remove them from the site.
